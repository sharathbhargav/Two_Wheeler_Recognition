# Two_Wheeler_Recognition

A deep learning model based on resnet50 to recognise common two wheeler vehicles found in Indian streets. This project is to practise 
concepts learned from [deep learning course from fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai/). For the dataset, images were downloaded from 
google images using the [script](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-download-google-images-using-python/). We do not own any of the images.
